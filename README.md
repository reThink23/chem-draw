# chem-draw
This project aims to be a fast Molecule Builder for the web as an alternative to existing ones which are not really user-friendly and feel clumsy.


## Focus
It focuses on:
- user-friendly
- intuitive
- fast in creating structures

## Short term TODO
- [x] arrow key functionality
- [x] change Atom type
- [x] validation of input
- [ ] add/correct focusing
- [ ] basic editing
- [ ] side chain handling
- [ ] change appearance of node based on atom type
- [ ] custom shortcuts
- [ ] group detection

### Won't Do
- [ ] how to generate (meaningful) unique ids/keys

## Long Term TODO
- [ ] Basic Application running, Arrow keys in use, add, create, modify simple chemical structures
- [ ] Other models of same structure (Stereochemistry - direction of bonds in 3D, Fischer projection, Haworth projection, Chair conformation)
- [ ] Creation of packages to reuse already created chemical structures for faster recombination (e.g. amino acids, DNA bases)
- [ ] Import/Export including common file types for molecules (.svg, .png, .mol, .smile, 3D-Model)
- [ ] detect & highlight functional groups or special bonds (ester, peptide)
- [ ] enable to control the lengths of bonds and right distances between molecules (with explicit mode to set them manually)
- [ ] different modes of viewing structure with complexity, from simple 2D structure to 3D
- [ ] (predicting) folding of created proteins with help of APIs (chemical databases, Alphafold) and display them
